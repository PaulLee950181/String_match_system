# String_match_system

Every input has a string and a few patterns. Every string has at most 32 characters, and the pattern has at most 8 characters.

After inputting a pattern, we have to determine whether a pattern is contained in the previously given string.

There are some special cases in the pattern, I describe it in the attachment.
